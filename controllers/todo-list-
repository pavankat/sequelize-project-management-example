1. I made a migration file 

sequelize migration:create --name giveAName

2. you would open that file and put in any changes to the database in the up part

refer to this if need help: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/docs/migrations/

3. you would reverse those changes in the down part

refer to this if need help: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/docs/migrations/

4. you would run your migration file

sequelize db:migrate

5. edit the model file to include the changes you made

6. you would edit the views (handlebars) 

7. you would update the routes in the controllers

8. you would test

9. if you're using nodemon beware of issues
